 - My character (any kind) is tagged as 'Player' but the doors won't open for him.
 - Make sure you have a collider that triggers the event (Capsule, ideally)
 
 - The living room seen on the Asset Store photo is not part of the package. Why?
 - Yes it is. Drag 'Greyplaster' material to the living room's walls and 'Woodenfloor' to its floor. (House version 1)
 
 - My character doesn't collide with the door when its open but I can't seem to find what code switches it off.
 - The animation clips themselves (Maindoor and roomdoors) turn the colliders off to prevent the character from getting stuck behind the door.
 Remove the respective animation key from both animation clips to keep the collider always on.
 
 - I'm having trouble changing audio clips for the different events.
 - Click on 'Access raw inspector' with the house selected to access arrays that store audio clips.
